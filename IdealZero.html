	<h1>Ideal Zero</h1>

	<p>This is a ballistic simulation to calculate maximum point blank range (MPBR) for a given cartridge, firearm, and target size.  MPBR is 
	defined as the longest range (minimum to maximum) that a given cartridge and firearm combination can be counted on to hit 
	a target of a given size with no hold-over or -under or sight adjustment.  This is similar to a battlefield zero.</p>
   
	<p>This version is unique in that it also accounts for dispersion, so that a group fired at the target should all end up on target 
	at any range within the MPBR.  To calculate a pure MPBR, use a dispersion of zero.</p>
	<p>To determine the hold-over or sight adjustments needed for targets beyond the MPBR, take the ballistic information and the MPBR 	
	elevation in MOA and enter it into the <a href="BallisticChart.html">Ballistic Chart</a> calculator, and it wil generate a table 
	showing the elevation adjustments needed out to the maximum accurate range of the cartridge.</p>
	
	<p>Interesting test cases, listed as type: velocity, BC, sight height, target diameter, dispersion:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>.22 LR with high mount scope:  1100, .1, 3, 2, 1</li>
		The .22 is limited by trajectory, with a group size at MPBR much smaller than the target diameter, while the high scope and small 
	target diameter mean there is a minimum point blank range greater than zero.  See how the use of high scope rings impacts the MPBR 
	by lowering the sight height.<br>
		<li>.45 pistol: 850, .22, .5, 8, 20</li>
		The .45 is limited by accuracy (20 MOA is a 2" group at 10 yards), which puts the far zero at the MPBR distance.  Reduce the 
	dispersion and see how that changes the zero.<br>
		<li>12 gauge slug: 1600, .11, 1, 8, 6</li>
		The 12 gauge slug is limited by both trajectory and accuracy; see what happens when the dispersion is reduced to 3 MOA.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Sight height is measured from the center of the bore to the top of the front sight post or bead, or to the center of the aperture for front aperture sights.  For scopes, measure to the center of the scope.</p>
