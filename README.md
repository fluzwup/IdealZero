# IdealZero
A program that uses information about a fiearm and cartridge combination with an external ballistics simulation to determine the ideal maximum point blank range zero.

The program uses the ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity, and sight height to calculate the trajectory of the bullet at any given angle of elevation relative to the line of sight.  Given the dispersion of fire (the group size) and the desired target size, the angle of elevation is changed to find the point at which any shot fired would be likely to hit a target of the desired size at the longest possible range.
